## Key Features

#### Parallel Workflow Processing
- Run workflows on multiple GPUs simultaneously with varied seeds
- Scale output with more workers
- Supports images and videos

#### Distributed Upscaling
- Accelerate Ultimate SD Upscale by distributing tiles across GPUs
- Intelligent distribution
- Handles single images and batches

#### Ease of Use
- Auto-setup local workers; easily add remote/cloud ones
- Convert any workflow to distributed with 2 nodes
- JSON configuration with UI controls

## Requirements

- ComfyUI
> Note: Desktop app not supported currently
- Multiple GPUs
- That's it

---

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository** into your ComfyUI custom nodes directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/robertvoy/ComfyUI-Distributed.git
   ```

2. **Restart ComfyUI** - If you'll be using remote/cloud workers, add `--enable-cors-header` to your launch arguments on the master

3. Read the [setup guide](https://github.com/robertvoy/ComfyUI-Distributed/blob/feature/cloud-workers/docs/worker-setup-guides.md) for adding workers

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>Does it combine VRAM of multiple GPUs?</summary>
No, it does not combine VRAM of multiple GPUs.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Does it speed up the generation of a single image or video?</summary>
No, it does not speed up the generation of a single image or video. Instead, it enables the generation of more images or videos simultaneously. However, it can speed up the upscaling of a single image when using the Ultimate SD Upscale Distributed feature.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Does it work with the ComfyUI desktop app?</summary>
Currently, it is not compatible with the ComfyUI desktop app.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I combine my RTX 5090 with a GTX 980 to get faster results?</summary>
Yes, you can combine different GPUs, but performance is optimized when using similar GPUs. A significant performance imbalance between GPUs may cause bottlenecks. For upscaling, setting `static_distribution` to `false` allows the faster GPU to handle more processing, which can mitigate some bottlenecks. Note that this setting only applies to upscaling tasks.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Does this work with cloud providers?</summary>
Yes, it is compatible with cloud providers. Refer to the setup guides for detailed instructions.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I make this work with my Docker setup?</summary>
Yes, it is compatible with Docker setups, but you will need to configure your Docker environment yourself. Unfortunately, assistance with Docker configuration is not provided.
